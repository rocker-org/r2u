## rocker/r2u: Rocker Containers for r2u

This repository provides containers for [r2u](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/). It extends /
revisits the initial containers provided by the [r2u](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/) project.

The containers are uploaded for each of the supported releases under their respective release names
(focal, jammy, noble) and release versions (20.04, 22.04, 24.04).  Builds are for the amd64 platform
and (on 24.04 aka noble only) also for arm64.

Please see [motivation](motivation.md) for how it fits in with other Rocker containers.
